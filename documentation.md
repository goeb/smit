## Command Line Usage

    Usage: smit [--version] [--help]
                <command> [<args>]

    Commands:

        init [<directory>]
            Initialize a repository in an existing empty directory. A repository
            is a directory where the projects are stored.

        addproject <project-name> [-d <repository>]
            Add a new project, with a default structure. The structure
            may be modified online by an admin user.
    
        adduser <user-name> [--passwd <password>] [--project <project-name> <role>]
                            [--superadmin] [-d <repository>]
            Add a user on one or several projects.
            The role must be one of: admin, rw, ro, ref.
            --project options are cumulative with previously defined projects roles
            for the same user.
    
        serve [<repository>] [--listen-port <port>] [--ssl-cert <certificate>]
            Default listening port is 8090.
            The --ssl-cert option forces use of HTTPS.
            <certificate> must be a PEM certificate, including public and private key.
    
        --version
        --help
    
    When a repository is not specified, the current working directory is assumed.
    
    Roles:
        superadmin  able to create projects and manage users
        admin       able to modify an existing project
        rw          able to add and modify issues
        ro          able to read issues
        ref         may not access a project, but may be referenced

### Example: Create repo and project
```
    mkdir myrepo
    smit init myrepo
    smit addproject -d myrepo myproject1
    smit adduser homer -d myrepo --superadmin --passwd homer --project myproject1 admin
    smit serve myrepo --listen-port 9090
```

And with your browser, go to: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

Note that on Windows the scripts `bin/init.bat` and `start.bat` help perform these steps, but you still may want to customize the repository name and admin user name.



## Project Configuration

The project configuration defines:

- the properties of the issues
- the tags
- the numbering scheme of the issues (local or global to several projects)
- the trigger (an external program to launch on new entries)

The configuration may be modified in two ways:

- via the web interface
    - only the properties may be managed this way
    - hot reload 
- via editing directly the configuration file, and performing a hot reload via the web interface

The configuration of a project is given by the file `project` in the directory of the project. 

### addProperty
```
addProperty <id> [-label <label>] [-help <help>] <type> [values ...]
```

`addProperty` defines a property.

- `<id>` is an identifier (only characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _)
- `<label>` is the text that will be displayed in the HTML pages (optional)
- `<help>` is a tooltip for properties inputs, displayed above properties labels (optional)
- `<type>` is one of text, select, multiselect, selectUser, textarea, textarea2

    * `text`: free text
    * `select`: selection among a list if given values
    * `multiselect`: same as select, but several may be selected at the same time
    * `selectUser`: selection among the users of the project
    * `textarea`: free text, multi-lines
    * `textarea2`: same as textarea, but spanned on 2 columns in the HTML
    
- `value` indicates the allowed values for types select and multiselect.

### setPropertyLabel

```
setPropertyLabel <propety-id> <label>
```

`setPropertyLabel` defines the label for a property. This is used for mandatory properties that are not defined by `addProperty`: id, ctime, mtime, summary.

### numberIssues
(smit version >= 1.4, no web interface)

```
numberIssues global
```

`numberIssues` defines the numbering policy of the issues.

If not defined, the issues are numbered reletively to their project: 1, 2, 3,...

If `global` is set, then the numbering is shared by all the projects that have this policy.


### tag
(smit version >= 1.3, no web interface)

Entries may be tagged.

```
tag <id> -label <text> [-display]
```

- `<id>` may contain only letters, digits and underscores.
- `<text>` is the text to display in the HTML page
- `-display` requires the display of a box in the headers of issues, that indicates if at least one entry of the current issue is tagged (this may be seen as a checkbox, to quickly verify that some quality criterion is met).

### trigger
(smit version >= 1.5, no web interface)

The trigger defines an external program to be launch after each new entry.

```
trigger <path>
```

- `<path>` must be a relative path inside the repository.

The external program will be given by smit the path to the new entry as first argument.

### Full example 

```
setPropertyLabel id "The ID"

addProperty status -label "The Status" select open closed
addProperty owner -label "The owner" selectUser

numberIssues global

tag test -label "Test Proof" -display

trigger public/sendEmail.sh
```


## Customize the HTML pages

One may customize the HTML and CSS pages. Some knowledge of HTML and CSS are needed.
Each instance of Smit serves one repository (also refered below as `$REPO`).

The Directories layout is typically:

    $REPO
    ├── project-A
    │   └── html
    │
    ├── project-B
    │   └── html
    │
    └── public


Smit grants read access to files under the `$REPO/public`, without restriction. Do not put confidential data in here.

By default the core HTML files are in `$REPO/public` and shared by all the projects of the repository: 

    signin.html
    issue.html
    issues.html
    newIssue.html
    project.html
    projects.html
    user.html
    view.html
    views.html

After a page modification, there is no need to restart Smit. Just reload the page.

### Customize the logo

Modify the `$REPO/public/logo.png` according to yours needs, or modify the HTML files to point to another logo.

### Customize the CSS

Modify `$REPO/public/style.css` and `print.css` according to your needs.

    
### The SM variables

In order to let a maximum customization freedom, Smit lets the user define the global structure of the HTML pages, and inserts the dynamic contents at users' defined places, indicated by SM variables:

    SM_DIV_ISSUE
    SM_DIV_ISSUE_FORM
    SM_DIV_ISSUE_MSG_PREVIEW
    SM_DIV_ISSUES
    SM_DIV_ISSUE_SUMMARY
    SM_DIV_NAVIGATION_GLOBAL
    SM_DIV_NAVIGATION_ISSUES
    SM_DIV_PREDEFINED_VIEWS
    SM_DIV_PROJECTS
    SM_DIV_USERS
    SM_HTML_PROJECT_NAME
    SM_RAW_ISSUE_ID
    SM_SCRIPT_PROJECT_CONFIG_UPDATE
    SM_URL_PROJECT_NAME
 
Some variables make sense only in some particular context. For instance,
`SM_RAW_ISSUE_ID` makes sense only when a single issue is displayed.

### Setting different HTML pages for 2 projects in the same repository.

The core HTML pages are first looked after in `$REPO/<project>/html/.` and, if not present, Smit looks in the `$REPO/public` directory.

Therefore, if you want to customize (for example) the 'issues' page for a project:

- copy `$REPO/public/issues.html` to `$REPO/<project>/html/issues.html`
- edit `$REPO/<project>/html/issues.html` to suit your needs

### Interface constraints

Be sure to not modify the following topics in the HTML pages, as they insure proper operation of Smit:

- keep the inclusion of `/sm/smit.js`. Smit uses this to update some dynamic contents on some pages (this file is included in the Smit executable).
- keep the name of the `SM_` variables 
- keep the `id="sm_..."`
- keep the `class="sm_..."`

## FAQ

### Why cannot I create a project named 'public'?

`public` is reserved for storing HTML pages that are public, such as the signin page.

The reserve keywords that cannot be used as project names are:

    public
    sm
    users
