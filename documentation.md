## Usage

    Usage: smit [--version] [--help]
                <command> [<args>]

    Commands:

        init [<directory>]
            Initialize a repository in an existing empty directory. A repository
            is a directory where the projects are stored.

        addproject <project-name> [-d <repository>]
            Add a new project, with a default structure. The structure
            may be modified online by an admin user.
    
        adduser <user-name> [--passwd <password>] [--project <project-name> <role>]
                            [--superadmin] [-d <repository>]
            Add a user on one or several projects.
            The role must be one of: admin, rw, ro, ref.
            --project options are cumulative with previously defined projects roles
            for the same user.
    
        serve [<repository>] [--listen-port <port>] [--ssl-cert <certificate>]
            Default listening port is 8090.
            The --ssl-cert option forces use of HTTPS.
            <certificate> must be a PEM certificate, including public and private key.
    
        --version
        --help
    
    When a repository is not specified, the current working directory is assumed.
    
    Roles:
        superadmin  able to create projects and manage users
        admin       able to modify an existing project
        rw          able to add and modify issues
        ro          able to read issues
        ref         may not access a project, but may be referenced

## Directories Layout

Each instance of Smit serves one repository (also refered below as `$REPO`).

The Directories layout is typically:

    $REPO
    ├── project-A
    │   └── html
    │
    ├── project-B
    │   └── html
    │
    ├── project-C
    │   └── html
    │
    └── public
    


## Create repo and project

    mkdir myrepo
    smit init myrepo
    smit addproject -d myrepo myproject1
    smit adduser homer -d myrepo --superadmin --passwd homer --project myproject1 admin
    smit serve myrepo --listen-port 9090

And with your browser, go to: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

Note that on Windows the scripts `bin/init.bat` and `start.bat` help perform these steps, but you still may want to customize the repository name and admin user name.




## Customize the HTML pages

Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS. These files are in `$REPO/public`:

    signin.html
    issue.html
    issues.html
    project.html
    user.html
    view.html
    views.html
    newIssue.html
    projects.html
    style.css


## Customize the logo

Modifiy the `$REPO/public/logo.png` according to yours needs.
    
## The SM variables

In order to let a maximum customization freedom, Smit let the user define the global structure of the HTML pages, and inserts the dynamic contents at users's defined places, indicated by SM variables:

    SM_DIV_ISSUE
    SM_DIV_ISSUE_FORM
    SM_DIV_ISSUE_MSG_PREVIEW
    SM_DIV_ISSUES
    SM_DIV_ISSUE_SUMMARY
    SM_DIV_NAVIGATION_GLOBAL
    SM_DIV_NAVIGATION_ISSUES
    SM_DIV_PREDEFINED_VIEWS
    SM_DIV_PROJECTS
    SM_DIV_USERS
    SM_HTML_PROJECT_NAME
    SM_RAW_ISSUE_ID
    SM_SCRIPT_PROJECT_CONFIG_UPDATE
    SM_URL_PROJECT_NAME
 
Some variables make sense only in some particular context. For instance,
`SM_RAW_ISSUE_ID` makes sense only when a single issue is displayed.


## FAQ

### Why cannot I create a project named 'public'?

`public` is reserved for storing HTML pages that are public, such as the signin page.

The reserve keywords that cannot be used as project names are:

    public
    sm
    users

### How to set up different pages for two projects?

HTML pages are first looked after in `$REPO/<project>/html/.` and, if not present, Smit looks in the `$REPO/public` directory.

So, for example, if you want to customize the 'issues' page for a project:

- copy `$REPO/public/issues.html` to `$REPO/<project>/html/issues.html`
- edit `$REPO/<project>/html/issues.html` to suit your needs
