<h1 id="issue-tracking">Issue Tracking</h1>
<p>Issue Tracking is the art of managing issues in order to get a clear status of unresolved issues and a history of what happened about all issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>⌘ Vocabulary</em></p>
<p>An issue database is more or less a 3D matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li>a row for each <em>issue</em></li>
<li>a column for each <em>property</em> (eg: a status is a property)</li>
<li>a depth axis for the <em>history</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The main pitfalls that issue tracker software have to tackle are:</p>
<ul>
<li>information is lost in a mass of issues</li>
<li>issue forms are encumbered with countless properties</li>
<li>interoperability is needed</li>
<li>reactivity of the screen interface</li>
</ul>
<p>This page explains how Smit has been designed to overcome these pitfalls.</p>
<h2 id="a-mass-of-issues">A mass of issues</h2>
<p>It is normal for an organization to have a mass of issues (thousands or tens of thousands). It is thus hard to find a particular issue by reading all.</p>
<p>To deal with this mass of issues Smit features:</p>
<ul>
<li>a &quot;one-click&quot; multi-property sorting interface</li>
<li>full text searching, that searches through all messages and properties</li>
<li>modular properties that enable adding tag properties easily</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="countless-properties">Countless properties</h2>
<p>Some organizations' issue trackers have a great number of properties because they want to deal with all possible cases. But this has the following disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>issues are encumbered with many properties, and that slows down the reading of the issues</li>
<li>some properties have been put there in case they are used in the future, but they are never used</li>
</ul>
<p>Smit tackles this pitfall as follows: it is really easy to add or modify properties at any time, and therefore there is no point in adding properties for future use.</p>
<p>Note that modifying a property in Smit does not threaten the integrity of existing issues.</p>
<h2 id="interoperability">Interoperability</h2>
<p>Organizations that care for sustainable activity do not want to be bound to a software. They want to be able to export or migrate the data from a software to another.</p>
<p>Organizations that care for business or industrial efficiency want to have their databases and software cooperate (talk together).</p>
<p>Smit's database is made of simple text files, easy to read and parse. Its format is publicly known as Smit is released under an open-source license.</p>
<p>Smit also provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSV format, for exportation to Excel or Calc</li>
<li>a full-contents view, suitable for printing or PDF export</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-reactivity">High reactivity</h2>
<p>Workers do not want to be slowed down by software. Nobody wants to wait for 10 seconds for the page to be displayed.</p>
<p>Smit is really fast. You do not have to wait, even when the database contains tens of thousands of issues.</p>
