# Issue Tracking

Issue Tracking is the art of managing issues in order to get a clear status of unresolved issues and a history of what happened about all issues.

The means to achieve these goals are:

- a status is given to each issue (typically open or closed)
- events and tasks about a given issue are logged with author and timestamp
- tagging and sorting, that help navigate through the issues

The most common difficulty that software tools have to tackle is dealing with a huge number of issues that hide the particular issues that we look for. For this reason Smit has been designed with advanced sorting and searching features.
