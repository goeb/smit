# Issue Tracking

Issue Tracking is the art of managing issues in order to get a clear status of unresolved issues and a history of what happened about all issues.

The main pitfalls that issue tracker software have to tackle are:

- information is lost in a mass of issues
- issue forms are encumbered with countless properties
- interoperability is needed
- reactivity of the screen interface

This page explains how Smit has been designed to overcome these pitfalls.

## A mass of issues
It is normal for an organization to have a mass of issues (thousands or tens of thousands). It is thus hard to find a particular issue by reading all.

To deal with this mass of issues Smit features:

- a "one-click" multi-property sorting interface
- full text searching, that searches through all messages and properties
- modular properties that enable adding tag properties easily

## Countless properties
Some organizations' issue trackers have a great number of properties 
because they want to deal with all possible cases. But this has the following disadvantages:

- issues are encumbered with many properties, and that slows down the reading of the issues
- some properties have been put there in case they are used in the future, but they are never used

Smit tackles this pitfall as follows: it is really easy to add or modify properties at any time, and therefore there is no point in adding properties for future use.

Note that modifying a property in Smit does not threaten the integrity of existing issues.


## Interoperability

Organizations that care for sustainable activity do not want to be bound to a software. They want to be able to export or migrate the data from a software to another.

Organizations that care for business or industrial efficiency want to have their databases and software cooperate (talk together).

Smit's database is made of simple text files, easy to read and parse.
Its format is publicly known as Smit is released under an open-source license.

Smit also provides:

- CSV format, for exportation to Excel or Calc
- a full-contents view, suitable for printing or PDF export

## High reactivity

Workers do not want to be slowed down by software. Nobody wants to wait for 10 seconds for the page to be displayed.

Smit is really fast. You do not have to wait, even when the database contains tens of thousands of issues.
