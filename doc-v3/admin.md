# Administration

Most administration tasks may be performed through the web interface, and require the role superadmin.

## Create a User

To define a user's profile you must specify:

- his/her identifier (typically his/her name, or an alias) that uniquely identifies him/her
- a password (except for some cases described below)
- permissions on the projects


## Create a Project

Project names cannot contain reserved "directory" parts.

The "directory" parts are those separated by slashes '/'. The reserved parts are:

- `config`, `files`, `issues`, `public`, `reload`, `sm`, `tags`, `users`, `views`
- any name starting with a dot `.`

Examples of forbidden project names:

- some-tech-project/public
- .cook
- kitchen/.cook

Note:

- When a new project is created, the permissions are updated according to the wildcards (see below). A new project can thus become automatically available to users if a wildcard matches.

## Set Permissions Up

Permissions of a user on some projects specifies which role the user will have on each project.


 Role    Description 
-------  ------------
admin    Allow user to edit project properties 
rw       (read-write) Allow user to create new issues and contribute on existing issues 
ro       (read-only) Allow user to view issues  
ref      Do not allow user to do anything, but user appears in select-user drop-down lists 
-------  ------------

Permissions on projects are specified by:

- a wildcard for the project(s)
- a role

If any wildcard collisions describe more than one role on a project, then the most restrictive role applies.

In the examples below, the Smit repository has 3 projects:

- Cookies-A
- Cookies-B
- Ribs-6

### Example 1

```
Wildcards : Roles         Resulting Permissions
-----------------------------------------------
Cookies-* : admin         Cookies-A : admin
Cookies-B : ro            Cookies-B : ro
                             Ribs-6 : none
```

### Example 2

```
Wildcards : Roles         Resulting Permissions
-----------------------------------------------
* : rw                    Cookies-A : rw
                          Cookies-B : rw
                             Ribs-6 : rw
```
